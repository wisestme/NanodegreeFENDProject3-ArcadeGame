# Title: Arcade Game Project
 ## Author: Nwagwu Chijioke
 ## Purpose: 
* ### Part of the requirements for completing my Nanodegree Google scholarship program at Udacity.
 * ### To display my ability to traverse and manipulate the DOM.
 * ### To display my ability to create and manipulate JavaScript objects and classes
 * ### To showcase my web development skillset.
 ## How the Game Works
 In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.
 * ### The player can move left, right, up and down
* ### The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
* ### Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* ### Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the score is increased.

 This repository is my project work to be reviewed and evaluated. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
 
 ## Method:
Using object Oriented JavaScript to implement Player and Enemy classes with  some provided methods to create the game play.

## Additional functionalities
In the nearest future, i hope to expand on the current functionalities by making the game available for play on touch screen devices.
I also hope to add collectibles during play to make the game play more exciting.
